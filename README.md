## What is This?

RNS Bulk Manager is your one-stop dashboard for managing Rootstock Name Service (RNS) domains. Instead of handling each domain separately, you can register, renew, and update multiple domains at once in a single transaction. This saves you tons of gas fees and time.

Think of it like managing multiple websites at once instead of doing them one by one.

## Why Use It?

### üí∞ Save Money
Every transaction on the blockchain costs gas fees. When you manage 10 domains individually, you pay the gas fee 10 times. But with bulk operations, you pay just once for all 10 domains. That's where the savings come from - up to 90% less in gas fees.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Save Time
What takes hours of clicking through transactions can now be done in minutes. Select your domains, choose your action, and execute. Simple as that.

### üéØ Stay Organized
Never lose track of your domains again. See all your registered domains in one place, know when they expire, and get alerts when it's time to renew.

### üîí Stay Safe
The smart contract is open source and deployed on Rootstock. Every operation is checked before it runs, and you maintain full control with your own wallet.

## What Can You Do?

### Register Multiple Domains
Want to secure your brand across different domain names? Register them all at once. The app checks if they're available before you submit, so you won't waste money on unavailable names.

- Real-time availability checking as you type
- Visual feedback showing which domains are free or taken
- Choose registration period (1, 2, or 5 years)
- All domains registered in one transaction

### Renew Your Domains
Got domains expiring soon? Renew them in bulk. Pick how many years you want to extend, select your domains, and renew them all together.

- See expiration dates at a glance
- Color-coded warnings (red for expired, yellow for expiring soon)
- Choose renewal period (1-5 years)
- Renew dozens at once

### Update Domain Settings
Changed your wallet address? Need to point domains to a new resolver? Update all your domains' addresses and resolvers simultaneously.

- Update addresses in bulk
- Change resolvers for multiple domains
- Ownership verified automatically
- All updates in one transaction

### Search Domain Availability
Planning to register a domain? Check if it's available first. Type in any name and instantly see if it's taken or free to register.

- Instant availability results
- See who owns taken domains
- ENS-like search experience
- Visual status indicators

## How It Works

**Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**
Open the app and connect your Rootstock wallet. This is the only permission needed - everything else is controlled by you.

**Step 2: Choose Your Action**
Navigate to the feature you need:
- **Register**: Create new domains
- **Renew**: Extend existing domains
- **Update**: Modify domain settings

**Step 3: Select Domains**
For bulk operations, pick which domains you want to manage. For new registrations, type the domain names you want.

**Step 4: Execute**
Confirm the transaction in your wallet. All selected operations happen together, and you pay gas fees only once.

**Step 5: Done**
Your domains update instantly. No waiting, no checking - it's all automatic.

## Who Is This For?

### Individual Users
Own multiple personal domains? Manage them efficiently without paying through the nose in gas fees.

### Projects & Brands
Launching a project or building a brand? Register all your related domains at once to secure your identity.

### Developers
Building on Rootstock and need domain management tools? Use the open-source code as a foundation for your own tools.

### DAOs and Organizations
Running a decentralized organization with many domains? Centralize domain management and reduce operational costs.

## Understanding the Savings

Let's say you want to register 10 domains individually:
- 10 separate transactions
- Each transaction costs gas fees
- Total cost: 10 √ó gas fees

With RNS Bulk Manager:
- 1 transaction for all 10 domains
- Same operations, single gas fee
- Total cost: 1 √ó gas fees

The more domains you manage, the more you save. Simple math, big savings.

## Built on Rootstock

RNS Bulk Manager is built specifically for the Rootstock Name Service ecosystem. Rootstock is the most secure smart contract platform in the world, and now managing your identities on it is more accessible than ever.

Whether you're a casual user securing a few domains or an organization managing hundreds, this tool makes it efficient and affordable.

## Safety & Security

- **Open Source**: Every line of code is public. Review it yourself on GitHub.
- **Smart Contract**: Deployed and verified on Rootstock Testnet. You can inspect every function.
- **Non-Custodial**: We never hold your domains or wallet keys. Everything stays with you.
- **Verified Operations**: The contract checks ownership before any operation.
- **Error Prevention**: Pre-validation prevents failed transactions before you pay gas.
