# RNS Bulk Manager - Deployment Status

## Current Status

**Networks**: RSK Testnet and Mainnet configured  
**Test Status**: ✅ 8/8 tests passing  
**Compilation**: ✅ Successful  
**Issue**: RSK Testnet public node is currently unreachable

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Use Alternative RSK RPC Endpoint

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
RSK_TESTNET_RPC=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY
```

Or use one of these alternative RSK endpoints:
- https://rsk-testnet.publicnode.com
- Your own RSK node
- Infura/Sepolia (if available for RSK)

### Option 2: Deploy to Local Network First

Test the deployment locally:

```bash
# This uses a local Hardhat network
hardhat run scripts/deploy-rns-bulk-manager.ts
```

### Option 3: Wait for Network Recovery

The RSK Testnet public node at `https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co` may be temporarily down. You can:
1. Check RSK status page
2. Try again later
3. Use a different RPC provider

## Contract is Ready

The contract is fully tested and ready to deploy. All that's needed is network connectivity.

## Next Steps

1. **Get Testnet RBTC**: Visit https://faucet.rsk.co/ to get testnet tokens
2. **Add RPC URL**: Update `.env` with working RSK endpoint
3. **Deploy**: Run `npm run deploy:testnet`
